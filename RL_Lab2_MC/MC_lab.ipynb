    "A very simple policy for Blackjack is to *stick* if we have 20 or 21 points and *hit* otherwise. We want to know how good this policy is. This policy is *deterministic* and therefore a function that maps an observation to a single action. Technically, we can implement this as a dictionary , a function or a class with a function, where we use the last option. Moreover, it is often useful (as you will see later) to implement a function that returns  the probability $\\pi(a|s)$ for the state action pair (the probability that this policy would perform certain action in given state). We group these two functions in a policy class. To get started, let's implement this simple policy for BlackJack."
